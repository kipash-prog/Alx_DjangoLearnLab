### 2. `retrieve.md`
Your `retrieve.md` file should include the expected output showing all attributes of the book. This is essential to demonstrate the retrieval step fully. Here's an example:

```markdown
# Retrieve Operation

Command:
```python
book = Book.objects.get(id=1)  # assuming id=1 is your book's id
print(book)  # This will display all attributes of the book

Book(id=1, title="1984", author="George Orwell", publication_year=1949)
