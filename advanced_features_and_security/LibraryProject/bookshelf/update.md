It looks like you accidentally reverted the title to `"1984"` instead of updating it to `"Nineteen Eighty-Four"`. Also, add comments for the expected output. Here's the corrected version:

```markdown
# Update Operation

Command:
```python
book.title = "Nineteen Eighty-Four"
book.save()
book
